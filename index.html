<h1 class="title">Rolling your own neural network framework</h1>

<p>We are going to build a neural network framework called LiFT. LiFT
stands for LIsp-Flavoured Tensor, following the trend of <a class="reference external" href="http://lfe.io/">LFE</a> in
naming. As pointed out by Phil Karlton, there are only two hard things
in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. LFE has
made naming a lot easier. If you are working on something inspired by
X and Y, and cannot think of a good name, just call it X Flavoured Y,
problem solved.</p>
<p>We show throughout this tutorial, by adopting rank of function from J
and piggybacking on integer set library, a neural network framework
could be built with much less effort.</p>
<p>LiFT can be served as a good starting point of your full-fledged
neural network framework. And LiFT does not limit itself to neural
network, it could also be a good choice if you need tensor and
gradient based optimization.</p>
