a simple example with autograd
==============================

Neural network is very popular these days. There are a great number of
tutorials on how to build a neural network. Very sad, most of them are
too complicated for me. I don't see how artificial neural network has
anything to do with layers of neurons. Fortunately, there is autograd.
